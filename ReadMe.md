# Tensored Django

In this project we demonstrated how to use the tensorflow library to create a neural network that can be used to classify 7 different emotions.

## Classes

```python
LABELS
Angry 0
Disgust 1
Fear 2
Happy 3
Neutral 4
Sad 5
Surprise 6
```
## Tools

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org) : The Python Programming Language
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) : The Web Framework for Python
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) : The TensorFlow Machine Learning Library used to create the neural network

## Prepare Dataset

We are building an Image classifier that can predict if the inputed image is a Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad or Surprise. We therefore need facial images of these emotions. The images are going to be used to train our algorithm on how to recognize these emotions. This is a supervised machine learning algorithm aka just like a teacher teaching a kid on how to recognize different animals.

We will used the Kaggle platform to get the data set [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013]

## Label Dataset

Just like a teacher will do, we will label each group of images so our kid (aka computer) can verify after performing a prediction.
